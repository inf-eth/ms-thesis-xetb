\section{Introduction}

This template can be found on the META website. 
Please use either a MS-Word\textregistered\ or a \LaTeX\ format file when preparing your full-paper submission. 
If another word processor than \LaTeX\ is used, please make sure that the appearance is similar to that of this sample.
Information for full-paper submission is available on the web at {\tt \small http://metaconferences.org/} under which you also will find instructions for paper preparation and usage of templates.

Full paper should be submitted electronically via {\tt \small http://metaconferences.org/} as a processed PDF. 
Acknowledgement of receipt of the submission will be sent to the contact-author e-mail address.

\section{Page layout and style}

Authors should observe the following rules for page layout. 
A highly recommended way to meet these requirements is to use a given template (MS-Word or \LaTeX) and check details against the corresponding example file.

\subsection{Basic layout features}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-1mm}
\item Paper length is maximum ten pages ({\bf A4} format)
\item Two columns are used except for the title part and possibly for large figures that need a full page width.
\item Margins of at least 15 mm (left/right), 25mm (top/bottom, except headers/footers).
\item Column width is 80 mm.
\item Spacing between columns is 10 mm.
\item Text height (without headers) is maximum 245 mm.
\item Check indentations and spacings by comparing to this example file (in pdf).
\item Title of the paper must be included and same with already submitted one-page abstract.
\item Name of author(s) must be included
\item Affiliation(s) of author(s) must be included
\item Title and author's name must be in larger font and in boldface
\item The abstract file should be converted into pdf format before its uploaded on the submission form
\item Maximum size of the attachment is 5 MB.
\end{itemize}

If you have any questions regarding paper submission please contact {\tt \small meta12@metaconferences.org}. 

\subsubsection{Headings}

Section headings are centered in boldface with the first word capitalized and the rest of the heading in lower case. 
Sub-headings appear like major headings, except they start at the left margin in the column.
Sub-sub-headings appear like sub-headings, except they are in italics and not boldface. 
See the examples given in this  file. 
No more than 3 levels of headings should be used.

\subsection{Text font}

Times or Times Roman font is used for the main text. 
Recommended font size is 10 points which is also the minimum allowed size. 
Other font types may be used if needed for special purposes. 
It is very important that while making the final pdf file, you EMBED ALL USED FONTS!

\subsection{Figures}

All figures must be centered on the column (or page, if the figure spans both columns).
Figure captions should follow each figure and have the format given in  Fig.~\ref{fig:sin}.
Figures which span two columns ({\em i.e.} occupy full page width) should be placed at the top or bottom of the page.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[t!]
%\centerline{\epsfig{figure=sample_figure,width=80mm}}
\caption{This is the figure caption. Color figures are acceptable.}
\label{fig:sin}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Tables}

An example of a table is shown as Table~\ref{table1}. 
Somewhat different styles are allowed according to the type and purpose of the table. 
The caption text must be above the table.

\begin{table}[tbh]
\caption{\label{table1} This is an example of a table.}
\vspace{2mm}
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
format & size [mm$^2$] & aspect ratio\\
\hline
A4     & $210 \times 297$ & 1.414 \\
JIS B5 & $182 \times 257$ & 1.414 \\
Legal  & $216 \times 356$ & 1.647 \\
Letter & $216 \times 279$ & 1.294 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}

\end{table}

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and numbered. 
Examples of equations are given below.
\begin{equation}
q=-\lambda \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial n} \right),
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the thermal conductivity.
Equation~(\ref{eq1}) is the differential form of Fourier's Law of thermal conduction.

\subsection{References}

References should be numbered in order of appearance, for example \cite{Zhang10}, \cite{Patankar80}, and \cite{Kays90,Kawa09}. 

\subsection{Submitted files}
Authors are requested to submit PDF files of their manuscripts. 
The PDF file should comply with the following requirements: 
(a) there must be no PASSWORD protection on the PDF file at all; 
(b) all fonts must be embedded; 
and (c) the file must be text searchable (do CTRL-F and try to find a common word such as 'the'). 
The proceedings editors will contact authors of non-complying files to obtain a replacement.
