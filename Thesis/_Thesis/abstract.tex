\chapter*{Abstract}
VHF (very high frequency) and UHF (ultra high frequency) communication takes place
between 54 MHz and 806 MHz. Channels are allocated specific frequency bands for
broadcast transmission. VHF ranges is between 30-300 MHz while VHF range is 300 MHz
and above. Between these broadcast channels lie un-utilized bands of frequencies
referred to as {\em whitespaces}. Efforts are underway~\cite{FCCTest} to utilize these
bands by designing devices which can effectively communicate at VHF/UHF frequencies
without interference with the existing broadcast TV channels.

To effectively communicate in the {\em whitespace} frequency ranges it is important
to design antennas which have a small form factor and multi-band operation. Also, the
bands of operation must be limited so as not to interfere with surrounding channels.
The goal of this thesis research work is to design such an antenna in the VHF/UHF range.

A microstrip patch antenna is naturally suited for this purpose due to ease of construction
and integration into mobile devices. Several novel patch antenna design techniques were studied
including metametarial-inspired monopole~\cite{tribandMM}, DNG (double negative) shell~\cite{DNGShell},
fractal antennas etc.
